# shoppingCart
This is a shopping cart front end with 3 products and a modal  for checkout. It has full functionality for adding and removing products.

<p>This was intended to be a full payment shopping cart using the stripe payment system. But this is just the front end for now. The backend was using express as a server and then making api calls to the stripe dashboard where you can see more product information and payments as well. </p>

<p>This was built with ReactJs, React-Bootstrap.</p>

<p>To run the project locally clone the repo to a folder. <br>
Then <code>cd folder-name</code>, <br>
Then run <code>npm start</code> in the terminal of your choice. <br> </p>
